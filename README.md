🚀 Customer Churn Prediction System
📌 Overview

Built an end-to-end machine learning system to predict customer churn using real-world telecom data.
The project covers data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → deployment via API, ensuring production-level reliability.

⚙️ Key Features
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering pipeline
✅ Multiple ML models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
✅ Model evaluation using:
Accuracy
F1 Score
ROC-AUC
✅ Feature importance analysis
✅ FastAPI deployment for real-time predictions
✅ Robust inference pipeline with schema alignment
🧠 Key Challenges & Solutions
🔴 1. Data Leakage
Identified leakage features like satisfaction_score, churn_score
Removed them to improve model generalization
🔴 2. Training vs Inference Mismatch
Model failed initially due to different input feature space
Fixed by:
Saving training columns (columns.pkl)
Aligning API input using reindex()

🔴 3. Deployment Errors
Handled serialization and API crashes
Built stable prediction pipeline with error handling
🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Models: XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
Deployment: FastAPI
Serialization: Joblib

📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	F1 Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	~0.76	~0.59	~0.81
Random Forest	~0.83	~0.67	~0.89
Gradient Boosting	~0.85	~0.71	~0.92
XGBoost	~0.84	~0.71	~0.91

👉 Final Model Used: Gradient Boosting (best balance of performance)
